# Changelog

## [0.5.0] - 2024-07-05
### Changed
- Internal changes around API request handling that normalizes OpenAPI and Anthropic requests so that the same downstream logic can be used for both. In case code depended on the old behavior this might be a breaking change, so I bumped the minor version.
- Fixes for org-ai-on-project:
  - Should now work with anthropic models
  - Fixed prompt/completion insertion behavior


## [0.4.9] - 2024-07-02
### Changed
- The changes to `org-ai--openai-get-token` were not working as intended. This is now fixed.


## [0.4.8] - 2024-07-01
### Changed
- `org-ai--openai-get-token` checks for empty string, fixes [#113](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/113), thanks @andreas-roehler!
- Use the value of `org-ai-service` when computing messages. This fixes an issue when e.g. anthropic was used as a service and no :service header arg was specified, e.g. in the non-org mode functions. Thanks @dangirsh!


## [0.4.7] - 2024-05-17
### Changed
Add new openai models to `org-ai-chat-models` and check if a model name is mistyped. Requested by [#110](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/110).

## [0.4.6] - 2024-05-13
### Added
Option to auto-fill paragraphs on insertion from the ai: With `(setq org-ai-auto-fill t)` set this behavior will invoke `fill-paragraph` on insertion when not inside a code block.


## [0.4.5] - 2024-05-08
### Changed
-  fix(org-ai-openai-image): make generating images work with Org 9.7. Thank you @JakDar!


## [0.4.4] - 2024-05-08
### Added
- org-ai blocks now accept a service parameter to switch between different endpoints and service-specific behavior:

```org
#+begin_ai :service anthropic
...
#+end_ai
```

The same can be achieved globally by setting `org-ai-service`. Possible values are listed [here](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/blob/master/org-ai-openai.el#L112).

- support for the Anthropic Claude API. See [the readme](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai#anthropic--claude)

- support for the perplexity.ai API. See [the readme](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai#perplexityai)


## [0.4.3] - 2024-01-03
### Added
- org-ai block attributes can now be set with org drawer propert (see https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/pull/99 https://github.com/rksm/org-ai#for-chatgpt) Thank you @doctorguile!
- Support for DALLÂ·E-3! Should now work out of the box. org-ai image blocks now also support attributes like `:model`, `:quality`, and `style`. See the [README](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai#for-dall-e) for details.

### Changed
- Fix for selecting text in `org-ai-prompt-in-new-buffer`


## [0.4.2] - 2023-12-26

### Added
- Added `org-ai-prompt-in-new-buffer` command to query for a prompt and then run that in a new buffer.

### Changed
- Mark `org-ai-default-inject-sys-prompt-for-all-messages` as deprecated. No need for this any longer.
- Fix inserting system prompt, thx @doctorguile!
- Added notes about how to use Azure and Azure specific auth, thx @tillydray

## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-10
### Changed
- Introduced `org-ai-oobabooga-create-prompt-function` that can be used to customize the prompt creation for local LLMs. It defaults to `org-ai-oobabooga-create-prompt-default` which uses the values of the variables `org-ai-oobabooga-system-prefix`, `org-ai-oobabooga-user-prefix` and `org-ai-oobabooga-assistant-prefix` to assemble the prompt text. Example:
```elisp
(funcall org-ai-oobabooga-create-prompt-function
         [(:role system :content "system")
          (:role user :content "hello")
          (:role assistant :content "world")])
;; => "PROMPT: system\n\nYou: hello\n\nAssistant: world\n\n"
```

## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-05
### Added
- Add support for local LLMs via [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). See [issue #78](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/78).

## [0.3.13] - 2023-08-20
### Changed
- add macro `org-ai--org-element-with-disabled-cache`. `org-element-with-disabled-cache` is not available pre org-mode 9.6.6. (resolves https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/77)

## [0.3.12] - 2023-08-19
### Changed
- Fix `org-ai-global-mode` definition (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/76)

## [0.3.11] - 2023-08-03
### Changed
- Add `(require 'org-macs)` for `org-element-with-disabled-cache` that was added in 0.3.10

## [0.3.10] - 2023-08-02
### Changed
- Allow dynamic `org-ai-on-region-file` (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/pull/71) (i.e you can add a function to handle it)
- Emacs 27 as minimal required version
- call `org-element-cache-reset` after insertion to avoid org warnings (see https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/16 and https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/63)
- Double check special block properties when extracting org-ai block.

## [0.3.9] - 2023-06-23

## [0.3.8] - 2023-06-08
### Added
- [Support](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/pull/57) for stable diffusion based image generation through [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) (Huge Thanks [@yaak0](https://github.com/yaak0)!).

```
#+begin_ai :sd-image
<PROMPT>
#+end_ai
```

### Changed
- Better [noweb](https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html) [support](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/pull/51). (Big Thank You [@togakangaroo](https://github.com/togakangaroo)!)

## [0.3.7] - 2023-06-04
### Changed
- make token retrieval via `auth-source` on demand

## [0.3.6] - 2023-05-30
### Changed
- fix for `string-equal-ignore-case` issue (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/53)
- documented use of greader/espeak (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/49)

## [0.3.5] - 2023-05-11
### Added
- noweb support (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/pull/46)

## [0.3.4] - 2023-05-11
### Changes
- Bind canceling `org-ai-on-project--confirm-selection` to `C-c C-k` instead of `C-c k`.

## [0.3.3] - 2023-05-11
### Changes
- Ensure that request errors are shown (fix [#43](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/43))
- Use markers instead of positions when inserting streamed content

## [0.3.2] - 2023-04-18

### Changes
- For the global mode, use a prefix-map. `org-ai-global-prefix-map`, it is bound to `C-c M-a` by default but can be easily bound to another key.
- don't show `org-ai-global-mode` in the mode-line
- no `show-trailing-whitespace` for org-ai-on-project
- load `org-ai-talk` by default

## [0.3.1] - 2023-04-17
### Added
- `org-ai-on-project`: Load by default.

### Changed
- with consecutive `org-ai-kill-region-at-point` invocations, append kill in right order ([#32](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/32))

## [0.3.0] - 2023-04-17
### Added
- `org-ai-on-project`: Offers a new method for running prompts and modifying multiple files at once.

### Changed
- `org-ai-on-region` (and related functions such as `org-ai-refactor`) do not quote user input with "> " anymore as this could be repeated in the output (see [#30](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/30))
- `org-ai-on-region` now outputs both prompt and answer into an `org-mode` buffer. This allows to easily edit the answer and re-run the prompt with `C-c C-c` (see [#29](https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/29)). You can customize the variable `org-ai-on-region-file` to specify a file to store the conversations in. E.g. `(setq org-ai-on-region-file (expand-file-name "org-ai-on-region.org" org-directory))`. New prompts will be appended.

## [0.2.6] - 2023-04-07
### Changed
- Deactivating read-only mode when reusing the `*org-ai-on-region*` buffer. This blocked repeated on-region requests if the buffer was still open.

## [0.2.5] - 2023-04-07
- Another attempt to fix unicode / multi-byte inputs. The string encoding we had before 0.2.3 was correct, but I missed that the entirety of the request body needs to be encoded as utf-8, including the headers need to be utf-8. In my case my openai auth token was not utf-8, and so i got a `Multibyte text in HTTP request` and wrongly assumed this is due to the content. This should be fixed now.

## [0.2.4] - 2023-04-04
### Changed
- Make 'org-ai-summarize' treat the region as text not as code (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/pull/22)
- fix "Error on checkbox C-c C-c after org-ai loaded" (https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/23)

## [0.2.3] - 2023-04-04
### Changed
- correctly encode UTF-8 strings when sending them to the API. This should fix non-ascii characters and multi-byte characters such as emojis in the input.
- start markdown codeblock AI responses on their own line (see https://github.com/rksm/org-ai/issues/17#issuecomment-1494970605)

## [0.2.2] - 2023-03-31
### Changed
- add `"ai"` to `org-protecting-blocks` to fix the block syntax highlighting.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-03-30
### Added
- `org-ai-switch-chat-model`
### Changed
- No max-tokens in ai snippet
- modified global shortcuts:
    - `C-c M-a r`: `org-ai-on-region`
    - `C-c M-a c`: `org-ai-refactor-code`
    - `C-c M-a s`: `org-ai-summarize`
    - `C-c M-a m`: `org-ai-switch-chat-model`
    - `C-c M-a !`: `org-ai-open-request-buffer`
    - `C-c M-a $`: `org-ai-open-account-usage-page`
    - `C-c M-a t`: `org-ai-talk-input-toggle`
    - `C-c M-a T`: `org-ai-talk-output-toggle`
### Removed
- Make greader dependency optional

## [0.2.0] - 2023-03-30
### Added

#### Speech input/output. Talk with your AI!
- In org-mode / `#+begin_ai..#+end_ai` blocks:
  - `C-c r` to record and transcribe speech via whisper.el in org blocks.
- Everywhere else:
    - Enable speech input with `org-ai-talk-input-toggle` for other commands (see below).
- Enable speech output with `org-ai-talk-output-enable`. Speech output uses os internal speech synth (macOS) or `espeak` otherwise.

#### Non-org-mode commands
- `org-ai-prompt`: prompt the user for a text and then print the AI's response in current buffer.
- `org-ai-on-region`: Ask a question about the selected text or tell the AI to do something with it.
- `org-ai-summarize`: Summarize the selected text.
- `org-ai-explain-code`: Explain the selected code.
- `org-ai-refactor-code`: Tell the AI how to change the selected code, a diff buffer will appear with the changes.

#### Other improvements
- In org-mode / `#+begin_ai..#+end_ai` blocks:
    - Press `C-c <backspace>` (`org-ai-kill-region-at-point`) to remove the chat part under point.
    - `org-ai-mark-region-at-point` will mark the region at point.
    - `org-ai-mark-last-region` will mark the last chat part.

#### Other commands
- `org-ai-open-account-usage-page` show how much money you burned.
- `org-ai-install-yasnippets` install snippets for `#+begin_ai..#+end_ai` blocks.
- `org-ai-open-request-buffer` for debugging, open the request buffer.

- Correctly assign system, user, assistant roles (see https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction). Before I mixed up system/assistant roles.

## [0.1.1] - 2023-03-06
### Initial release
`#+begin_ai...#+end_ai` blocks that can be used for:
- chatgpt input / output
